# Odin Landing Page

## Overview
It's a landing page that I had to replicate from the images provided the Odin Project. This little project taught me a lot about flexbox and CSS properties, and how to utilize them in niche cases. It also made me have a habit of doing conventional commit messages.

## Details
Mainly in the application of flexbox, I learned about things such as; how to nest containers and why, and how they help with object or item alignment. Then I also learned some more CSS properties as I went down the rabbit hole of doing this project.

Aside from learning flexbox and applying the CSS properties, I also solidified my knowledge of git commit conventions. This project made me practice those commit conventions as much as possible and the end result came out to be great. My commit feels a bit more professional than before and I'm glad that committing my messages in this manner has become my second-nature now.
